OUTLIERS is an interactive audio-visual journey where participants navigate a global swarm of lives that highlight unexpected connections created by common humanity. The aim is to defeat stereotypes and dogmas by sharing experiences.

The installation will harness the collective personae of 1000+ subjects, crowd-sourced in advance. Generative and interpretive algorithms will slice and dice this ever-evolving swarm of humanity, highlighting commonality and revealing disjointedness.
The shifting forms of the dataset will be influenced by the interactions of participants in the gallery and world-wide via a connected app and website. Participants will follow trajectories of recorded stories structured around keywords such as [#BlackLivesMatter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BlackLivesMatter), [#CitizenScientist](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CitizenScientist), [#WomenInSTEM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WomenInSTEM), and []#YouthForClimate](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23YouthForClimate).

Supported by cutting-edge university research, the dataset for the installation will consist of talking heads recounting galvanising personal stories. This project will reach into the future by forging bonds between subjects with common aspirations.

# MISSION

Our mission is to help communities come together and help people find their own communities by exploring the connections and biases we all use when searching for our own swarms. We are here to play with your perceptions, share the stories of people who can inspire you, and show you a reflection of your yourself in a different culture, colour, gender, religion.

OUTLIERS exist everywhere, spontaneous, and unexplained. What made us this way? What made us just different enough to stand out but not different enough to belong somewhere else? And are we truly as different as we think?

We hope to create connections within science and from science outward, to art, citizenship, activism, film, community. Our goal is to find the links that connect all of us to the world and forge new links, build new communities, connect the outliers and tell a bigger story of inclusion, acceptance and kindness.

Come share your story and join us on this journey.

We are all OUTLIERS and you are not alone anymore.
